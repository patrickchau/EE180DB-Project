UDP client connection between OpenCV and Unity
Unity -> OpenCV : which user we need to display
OpenCV -> Unity : the bounding box on the image that displays chosen user
OpenCV handles all the processing. Unity only displays in application
Both applications share the same webcam stream
get all 4 players initially. opencv won't always send an update so
need to make sure that each rect is associated with right face

cant both access the same webcam stream at the same time so need to write
an image from the stream and then have python read in the image into
opencv
